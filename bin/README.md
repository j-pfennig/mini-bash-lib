Sources and packed library code
-------------------------------

The minify tool can strip comments and extra spaces from the library sources.
The proxy will load the packed source if the packed version is newer than the
library source itself. The sources are at:

        ./src/mini-bash-lib/mini-bash-lib

*End*
