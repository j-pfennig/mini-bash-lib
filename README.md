**'mini-bash-lib' is a small source only bash application frame-work**

It can be
installed as shared source or that can be embed directly into scripts. For the
shared installation it supports internationalisation (GNU gettext).

It was written to be small and easy to use. It has only 1% of the size of the
larger 'centauri-bash-lib' framework. 

**centauri-bash-lib compatibility and coexistence**

The 'mini-bash-lib' framework is stand-alone but is compatible with 'centauri-bash-lib'.
The shared installation will automatically load 'centauri-bash-lib' if installed.
